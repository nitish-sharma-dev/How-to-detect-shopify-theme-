These days many people find shopify themes as per like refrence one. But only some of know how to find it in some cases.
  If refrence site is using "Minimal theme" 
  and can't change the theme name from the SCHEMA file then you can find it easily. 
  I'm going to expalin below how you can find or detect shopify theme
    1. Just goto store front end which one you want to check for a theme and then open “View Page Source”
    2. for “View Page Source” you can use shortcuts for
         > MacOS -  (Command + Option + U)
         > Windows - (Ctrl + U)
    3. A new tab will open with the HTML code for the website. You can detect the Shopify theme by pressing Command + F and searching for “Shopify.theme”.
    This will identify the piece of code that lists the theme name and jump you to a snippet that looks something like this: https://prnt.sc/1v5wea7
    4. As you can see in attached print screenshot link, in line 117, the name of the Shopify theme in use is "Minimal." 

  If in case the name of theme from SCHEMA file changed then you can't find the shopify theme name.
